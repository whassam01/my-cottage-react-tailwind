          <p>
            Cottage does not sell alcohol beverages. Cottage is a marketing and technology company
            that provides services to Food Producers or other establishments that may hold alcohol
            beverage licenses (hereinafter, “Alcoholic Beverage Suppliers”). Cottage acts as a third
            party provider and has no responsibility or liability to you for any alcoholic beverage
            products you purchase from Alcoholic Beverage Suppliers. Any claims or disputes you have
            regarding Alcoholic Beverage Supplier products will be the responsibility of the
            Alcoholic Beverage Supplier and must be brought by you directly to the Alcoholic
            Beverage Supplier.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to purchase alcoholic beverages from Alcoholic Beverage Suppliers, you must
            be at least twenty-one (21) years old ("Legal Age"), provide age verification, and
            consent to having such verification shared with the Alcoholic Beverage Suppliers.
          </p>
          <p>
            By placing an order for alcoholic beverages, you expressly represent and warrant that:
          </p>
          <p>You are of Legal Age;</p>
          <p>
            You will provide bona fide government-issued photo identification showing your Legal Age
            upon delivery or pickup;
          </p>
          <p>
            You are purchasing alcoholic beverages for personal consumption and not for resale or
            any other commercial purpose; and
          </p>
          <p>
            You are not procuring alcohol from Alcoholic Beverage Suppliers for person(s) under the
            Legal Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cottage reserves the right to report any actions by you that would violate alcohol
            beverage laws, including but not limited to misrepresentation of age and procuring
            alcoholic beverages for person(s) under age 21, to law enforcement authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cottage does not charge any additional fee with respect to alcoholic beverages or your
            purchase of alcoholic beverages from Alcoholic Beverage Suppliers. When you place an
            order for alcoholic beverages using the Services ("Alcoholic Beverage Order"), such
            Alcoholic Beverage Order will be either accepted or rejected by the Alcoholic Beverage
            Supplier to whom the Alcoholic Beverage Order was placed. Neither Cottage nor any
            courier has any authority to accept your Alcoholic Beverage Order, and no sale pursuant
            to your Alcoholic Beverage Order will become final unless and until Alcoholic Beverage
            Supplier accepts your Alcoholic Beverage Order.
          </p>
          <p>
            For any Alcoholic Beverage Order accepted by an Alcoholic Beverage Supplier (such
            accepted sale an "Alcoholic Beverage Purchase"), your credit card will be charged, and
            that portion of the funds from your credit card payment that relates to the Alcoholic
            Beverage Purchase will be deposited into an account for the benefit of Alcoholic
            Beverage Supplier in compliance with applicable alcoholic beverage laws.

            of using these particular components or features of the Service. Cottage is not
            responsible for the performance of any third party services.

            You consent to accept and receive communications from us, including e-mail, text
            messages, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number you provide to
            us. These communications may be generated by automatic telephone dialing systems which

            authentication, reminders, and other notifications. Standard message and data rates
            applied by your cell phone carrier may apply to the text messages we send you. You may
            opt-out of receiving communications by following the unsubscribe options we provide to
            you. You may also opt-out of text messages from Cottage at any time by texting STOP to
            the number in your transactional text message. You acknowledge that opting out of
            receiving communications may impact your use of the Services.

            You agree to pay all charges, including gratuities, fees and taxes, and any part
            thereof, when you purchase, use, or participate in a Service from Cottage. All fees are

            for the payment of any such taxes that may be imposed on your use of the services
            provided to you. Cottage may change the fees for the Service at any time. Cancellations

          </p>
          <p>
            You may be asked to provide us with a credit card number from a card issuer or other
            payment information that we accept in order to activate and/or pay for any fees related
            to the Service. We may seek pre-authorization of your credit card or other payment
            information prior to a purchase to verify that the credit card or payment information is
            valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. These
            pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until
            it is released or reconciled with the actual charge. Please contact your card issuer if
            you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed
            from your statement.

          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>15. SUBSCRIPTIONS AND RECURRING CHARGES</p>
          <p>
            Some Food Producers using the Cottage service provide subscriptions, in which the Food
            Producer provides a certain amount of food or meals on a recurring basis in exchange for
            an automated, recurring payment by you. You agree that any charges marked as
            subscriptions are recurring and that your credit card or other method of payment will
            continue to be automatically charged until you cancel using the Cottage website. You
            further agree that the subscription agreement is between you and the Food Producer and
            that Cottage is not responsible for ensuring that the Food Producer is delivering the
            agreed upon types or quantity of meals, or their equivalent. You agree that any
            disagreement regarding the value or commitment of the subscription will be resolved
            between you and the Food Producer.

            your account contact us using the Contact section of our website. Any fees paid by you
            prior to your termination are nonrefundable (except as expressly permitted otherwise by
            these TOS). Termination of your account will not relieve you of any obligation to pay
            any accrued fees or charges. We may at any time, under any circumstances and without
            prior notice, immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your account and/or
            access to the Service. Any such termination or suspension will be made by us in our sole
            discretion, without any refund to you of any prepaid fees or amounts, and we will not be
            responsible to you or any third party for any damages that may result or arise out of
            such termination or suspension of your account and/or access to the Service.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>17. EFFECT OF TERMINATION</p>
          <p>
            Upon termination of your account you lose all access to the Service and any portions
            thereof, including, but not limited to, your Cottage Account. In addition, Cottage may
            delete all information and data stored in or as a part of your account(s) including, but
            not limited to, data files, email, preferences and Submissions. Any individual
            components of the Service that you may have used subject to separate agreement will also
            be terminated in accordance with such separate license.

          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>22. WAIVER</p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that the seller of any food or beverage is the applicable Food
            Producer and, that as the seller, the Food Producer will be fully responsible for any
            and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by you,
            caused in whole or in part by the Food Producer, as well as for any unclaimed property
            liability arising from unredeemed orders or portions thereof. You waive, and release
            Cottage and its officers, directors, employees and agents from, any claim, liabilities,
            damages, or injury arising from or related to any act or omission of a Food Producer in
            connection with the goods provided in connection therewith and/or as it relates to

          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>23. DISPUTES</p>
          <p>
            “Disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and Cottage,
            its partners (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors, or employees) including

          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>24. BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION</p>
          <p>
            You and Cottage agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has
            the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER
            THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS
            ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND CONSOLIDATION WITH
            OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A
            JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST COTTAGE. If any
            provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable
            provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in
            no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All Disputes will be
            resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single
            arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) according
            to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. The Federal
            Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1­16, fully applies. Any arbitration hearing will occur in
            Seattle, Washington, or another mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator’s award will
            be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. We will pay all the arbitration fees due to the American Arbitration
            Association for any Dispute. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally
            entitled to attorney’s fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For
            any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorney’s
            fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that
            your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you
            and Cottage also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees,
            predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the
            Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree
            that any judicial proceedings will be brought in, and you consent to, the exclusive
            jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City of Seattle, King County,
            Washington, or federal court for the state of Washington.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>25. GOVERNING LAW</p>
          <p>
            These TOS and any Dispute will be governed by Washington law and/or applicable federal
            law (including the Federal Arbitration Act) as applied to agreements entered into and to
            be performed entirely within Washington, without regard to its choice of law or
            conflicts of law principles.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>26. LIMITATION ON TIME TO INITIATE A DISPUTE</p>
          <p>
            Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year
            after the cause of action accrues.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>27. ASSIGNMENT</p>
          <p>
            These TOS, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or
            assigned by you and any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>28. GENERAL</p>
          <p>
            These TOS and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies, are a complete statement of
            the agreement between you and Cottage regarding the Services. In the event of a conflict
            between these TOS and any other Cottage agreement or Policy, these TOS will prevail and
            control the subject matter of such conflict. You may also be subject to additional terms
            and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content, or
            third-party software. If any part of these TOS or Additional Terms is held invalid or
            unenforceable, that portion will be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law
            to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the
            remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. The failure of Cottage to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these TOS will not constitute a waiver of
            such right or provision. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these
            TOS, there will be no third-party beneficiaries to these TOS.
